# Linear Regression From Scratch (Beginner Friendly)

This repository is designed to help **absolute beginners** understand **Linear Regression** from the ground up using Python.

Instead of jumping directly into complex libraries, this project focuses on:
- core concepts
- mathematical intuition
- step-by-step implementation
- clean and readable code

If you are new to **Machine Learning**, this project is for you.
